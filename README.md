# Resume


As a third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering 
(AIML specialization) at Vellore Institute of Technology, I am passionate about developing impactful 
software and solving real-world problems through code. At on the mission to empower every 
person and organization on the planet resonates deeply with my own aspirations to use technology 
for scalable and meaningful change. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated a solid foundation in Data Structures & 
Algorithms, and Full-Stack Development, complemented by hands-on experience with Machine 
Learning and Cloud Technologies. My projects—including a full-stack Book Store application using 
the MERN Stack and an AI-powered Heart Disease Prediction System—reflect my commitment to 
designing solutions that are both innovative and user-centric. Additionally, my internship at India 
Space Lab offered me an interdisciplinary exposure to AI, drone systems, and satellite solutions, 
sharpening both my technical depth and collaborative mindset. 
I’ve also pursued independent learning through Coursera, completing rigorous courses in Applied 
Machine Learning and Supervised Machine Learning, and have solved over 200+ DSA problems on 
LeetCode, demonstrating both problem-solving ability and consistency. As a Freelancer at Outlier, 
I’ve delivered high-accuracy outputs in real-world assessment workflows, often under tight 
deadlines.
I am eager to bring my Growth Mindset, Technical Versatility, and Collaborative 
Energy.
